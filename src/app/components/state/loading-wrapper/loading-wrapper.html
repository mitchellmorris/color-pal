<!--
  This component is meant to be a simple wrapper 
  for any content that needs to show a loading state.
  This is typically used for resolvers that need to load data before the component can be shown.
  I placed this in an @if block so that there is no residual content or component logic.
-->
@if (isLoading()) {
<div class="flex h-full items-center justify-center">
    <div class="text-2xl mb-4 font-thin">{{ loadingText() }}</div>
</div>
} @else {
<ng-content></ng-content>
}
